# ALab Dataset

For several 3D scene reconstruction tasks, it is difficult to obtain per-pixel-accurate ground truth from real images, along with a mesh wich topology is close to production-level assets. 
We propose this photorealistic synthetic dataset created from the (Animal Logic ALab)[https://dpel.aswf.io/alab/) project.

# Content

It is composed of 5 sequences for multi-view-reconstruction and 20 panorama sequences for a total of 520 frames.
Rendered frames are provided, along with ground truth camera poses and intrinsics in [meshroom](https://alicevision.org/) format.

The blender project is also provided.
